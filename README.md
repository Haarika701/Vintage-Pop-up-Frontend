# Vintage-Pop-up-Frontend
### `About our Project`
This would be our third project created at Flatiron School. This project was done with about 6-9 weeks of learning Javascript, React, Ruby with ActiveRecord and SQL. We had imagined our project to encapsulate an E-commerce single page application. We wanted to create this project to show our knowledge with SQL and creating our own frontend and backend functionality. The main focus of this project was to build our backend fully flushed out.
 
The core deliverables of this project are
 
1. Use Active Record to interact with a database.
2. Have a minimum of two models with a one-to-many relationship.
3. Create API routes in Sinatra that handles at least three different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
4. Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
5. Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.
 
We accomplished all of the deliverables for our project and even more! We wanted our User to be able to visit the site to view multiple vintage items and to be able to go to a different page that allows the user to Purchase the item. Once the item is purchased it gets rid of the item off of the homepage. We also added a Sell route that would allow users to create their own Vintage products to POST to our Homepage. Our favorite part of this project was creating our own backend server to work off of. The hardest part was routing and creating links to speak with one another.
 
### `Stretch Goals`
For our project we would have liked for a User sign in and to use a PATCH request. The user sign in would have allowed each user to have a cart that would enable the ablilty to store data based on what our user was clicking. It also would make the purchasing process much easier as the User would be able purchase multiple items at a time. The cart to be able to show how much their purchases would cost in total. Create a mock shipping label for the User. Additionally, we wanted our purchase button to have a message show up indicating that the person had purchased a product.
 
### `Conclusion`
The project we completed is something that our team is proud of and happy to share. Hopefully our E-commerce website is something that all users can enjoy and experience. Also, we are hoepful that our project is able to be used by other associates and students at Flatiron school. We appreciate you taking the time to read the README!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
